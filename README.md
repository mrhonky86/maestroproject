# 🏆 The Maestro World Dungeon 🏆

> **"Flattened into code. Survival is the only curriculum."**

Welcome to the collaborative group project for the **Maestro Cohorts**. This is a text-based adventure game built by beginners, for beginners, inspired by the snarky survival stakes of *Dungeon Crawler Carl*.

## 📖 The Story
The world has been compressed into a terminal interface by a mysterious AI known as **The Maestro**. You are a "Crawler"—a student whose physical form has been converted into a dictionary of stats. To log out and return to reality, you must navigate the **Curriculum of Chaos**, floor by floor, room by room.

## 🛠️ Project Goals
- **Collaborative Coding:** Every student contributes exactly one "Room" (a Python function).
- **Version Control:** We use **GitHub Desktop** to manage our code and learn the industry-standard "Pull-Commit-Push" workflow.
- **Python Fundamentals:** Practice variables, conditionals, functions, and list management.

## 🗺️ Dungeon Map (Floor 1)
- [x] **The Entrance** (MrHonky)
- [ ] **The Terminal** (Open)
- [ ] **The Breakroom** (Open)
- [ ] **The Coffee Grotto** (Open)
- [ ] **The Infinite Loop Hallway** (Open)
- [ ] **The Boss: Syntax Sentinel** (Locked)

## 🚀 How to Contribute
1. **Claim a Room:** Check the `#🗺️-dungeon-map` in Discord and claim a spot in `#💬-dev-chat`.
2. **Setup:** Clone this repository using **GitHub Desktop**.
3. **Workflow:** - **PULL** the latest changes before you start.
   - **CODE** your assigned function in `main.py`.
   - **COMMIT** your changes with a clear message.
   - **PUSH** your code to the team.

## ⚠️ Coding Standards
To keep the game from crashing, please ensure:
- Your function name matches the map (e.g., `def the_terminal():`).
- You use the global `player` dictionary for stats.
- You link your room to the next function on the map.
